      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>During this presentation we will be reviewing code samples that fail accessibility testing, discuss why they failed, and identify how to remediate the code to comply with WCAG 2.0 standards. We will also cover common tools and resources that will help while you audit, remediate, and test your websites.</p>
