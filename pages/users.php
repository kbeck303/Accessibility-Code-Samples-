      <h1>Types of Users</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>User who can see and hear and can use the mouse and keyboard (ie. the average user). Easiest to achieve.</li>
        <li>User who can see and hear but can only use a keyboard (ie. a person with MS or some other physical disability). Some thought is needed to allow this user to navigate through the site in a useful way.</li>
        <li>User who cannot see, but can hear and uses the keyboard (ie. a blind person). This is the hardest to achieve, we need to think about what visual pieces of the site are important or are just there for decoration. If it is important, we need to find a way to verbally describe these visual features.</li>
